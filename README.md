### Description

Use this nifty program to combine files into a single binary file. Allows you to Combine and Extract files using a simple, easy to use, interface. Great for protecting your files when you distribute your apps/games. Also keeps your files seperate from you EXE so to update your app/game's graphics or sounds etc all you need to do is redistribute the binary file. If you like it a vote would be nice. If you hate it please tell me why. =]

Vist my website www.pointystudios.cjb.net

### More Info
 
1a. A list of files and their paths

2a. Path to a binary file

1b. Single Binary File

2b. All files stored in that binary file

If you set the input files to be deleted and you create a binary file be warned that it the binary file becomes damaged then there is no way to retrieve the lost files. So BACKUP your originals. I cannot be held responsible for any unwanted side effects. =]
